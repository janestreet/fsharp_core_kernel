synopsis: "Extensions of the dotnet standard library"
description: "
Core_kernel contains F# libraries that are shared across all of our F# projects. It is meant to mirror the use-case of our OCaml Core library. Many libraries just alias dotnet standard library tools to be consistent with Jane Street's naming style.

Our F# projects use relative paths for project references. It is likely that these will
need to be modified depending on your directory structure. [fsharp_core_kernel] has a
dependency on another one of our open source projects [fsharp_bin_prot].
